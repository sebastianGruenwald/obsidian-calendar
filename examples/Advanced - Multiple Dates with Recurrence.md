# Department Heads Meeting

This is an advanced example combining multiple dates with recurring events.

## How This Works

This note demonstrates using **both** multiple dates AND recurrence:

1. **Initial Dates**: January 8 and February 12, 2025
2. **Recurrence**: Monthly - each date will recur every month

This means you'll see this event on:
- January 8, 2025 (then monthly: Feb 8, Mar 8, Apr 8, etc.)
- February 12, 2025 (then monthly: Mar 12, Apr 12, May 12, etc.)

## Use Cases

This pattern is useful for:

- **Multiple recurring series**: Two different weekly meetings in one note
- **Staggered schedules**: Events that happen on different dates but both recur
- **Flexible planning**: Start dates that differ but follow same pattern

## Meeting Details

- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Location**: Board Room or Virtual
- **Participants**: All department heads
- **Agenda**: Strategic planning and coordination

## Notes

This is a powerful feature combination that provides maximum flexibility
for complex scheduling scenarios.
